        <column1 info='wikipidea'>A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor, or just processor,
                    is the most important processor in a given computer.</column1>
        <column2 info='wikipedia'>Random-access memory (RAM; /r√¶m/) is a form of electronic computer memory that can be read and
                    changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code.</column2>
        <column3 info='wikipedia'>Computer data storage or digital data storage is a technology consisting of computer components and

        <column2 source='Google'>A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of
                    time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory, in contrast with other
                    direct-access data storage media (such as hard disks and magnetic tape)</column2>
