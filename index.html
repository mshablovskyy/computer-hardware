    <p style="font-style: italic;">Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a computer, such as the central 
        processing unit (CPU), random access memory (RAM), motherboard, computer data storage, graphics card, sound card, 
        and computer case. It includes external devices such as a monitor, mouse, keyboard, and speakers.
        By contrast, software is a set of written instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. 
        Hardware derived its name from the fact it is hard or rigid with respect to changes, whereas software 
        is soft because it is easy to change.</p>

                <p>A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor, or just processor, 
                    is the most important processor in a given computer. Its electronic circuitry executes instructions 
                    of a computer program, such as arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations. 
                    This role contrasts with that of external components, such as main memory and I/O circuitry, 
                    and specialized coprocessors such as graphics processing units (GPUs).</p><!text>

                <p>A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit initially designed for digital image 
                    processing and to accelerate computer graphics, being present either as a discrete video card or embedded on 
                    motherboards, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles. After their initial design, 
                    GPUs were found to be useful for non-graphic calculations involving embarrassingly parallel problems due to 
                    their parallel structure. Other non-graphical uses include the training of neural networks and
